# DLMG - Deep Learning Model Generator

DLMG is a python tool to generate deep learning based classifier models. It uses Google's Inception-V3 in a re-training  process *(transfer learning)* in order to generate new classifiers for untrained classes.

DLMG also provide tools to classify generic data into Inception-V3 known classes and then train a new model with the classified data.
